Suggestion Algos

1. Streak flow for isolating better indexes

2. Field addition suggestion algo:
Suggest adding missing fields by existing flow. To determine operation on suggested fields, check how many hops from left and right.
	If hops from left > right => eq
	If hops from right > left => range

3. Existing field operation change suggestion algo:
Check if any range fields have greater hops than equality fields
	If true => Suggest making that field equality and move on.
	If false => Correct operation, move on.
	
4. No equality -> range
